## Clock Scene Manager

The Clock Scene Manager allows you to create and manage multiple clock configurations for different scenes in your stream.

### Features

- Create named clock scenes with unique configurations.
- Generate direct URLs for OBS browser sources.
- Manage all your clock scenes in one place.
- Each scene maintains its own settings.
- Sort and search through your scenes.
- Delete scenes you no longer need.

### How to Use

1. Open `scene-manager.html` in your web browser to access the Scene Manager.
2. Create a new clock scene with a descriptive name.
3. Copy the browser source URL.
4. Add to OBS as a browser source.
5. Configure the clock's appearance in OBS.
6. All settings will be saved for that specific scene.

## Tips for Streamers

- **Use Multiple Scenes**: Create different clock styles for different scenes (e.g., a vibrant clock for your starting scene, a transparent one for gameplay).
- **Use Transparent Theme**: For gameplay streams, the transparent theme provides time information without blocking gameplay.
- **Match Your Brand**: Use the color pickers to match your stream's color scheme.
- **Position Strategically**: Place in a corner where it won't overlap important HUD elements in games.

## Troubleshooting

- **Clock Not Visible**: Make sure the browser source is properly sized and positioned.
- **Settings Not Appearing**: Click directly on the gear icon that appears when hovering over the clock.
- **Settings Panel Off Screen**: Try moving the clock away from the edge of your canvas.
- **Dropdown Menus Not Working**: OBS has known issues with dropdown menus in Browser Sources. The clock now has a built-in "OBS/Streamlabs Mode" (enabled by default) which replaces dropdowns with compatible button selectors. If you still have issues, check that this mode is enabled in the settings panel.
